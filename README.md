# RAIL-12D-Hyper-Engine
A self-regulating 12D dynamical engine for AI trajectory control. Fuses Riemannian geometry (FCES), White Hole steering, and RAIL-FPMF adaptive gating into a single-file Python reference implementation. Features multi-rate gradients and "LITE/NORMAL/FULL" compute tiers for zero-latency interference.
